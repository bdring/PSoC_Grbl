# PSoC_Grbl
PSoc5 Port of Grbl CNC Controller

This is a port of the amazing [Grbl CNC Controller](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) firmware to the [Cypress PSoC 5 CPU](http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-5). Grbl is targeted at the Atmel ATMega328P and ATMega2650 8 bit CPUs.  The PSoC 5 is a much more powerful CPU and is a mixed signal processor.
